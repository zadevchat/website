Important dates:

Mid-January 2016 - Ticket Sales Open
18 January - CFP closes
8 March - Conference day

This one day multi-track conference aims to help developers skill up in their respective focus areas, with a strong focus on local presenters sharing knowledge with their local audience. 

There are still plenty of speaker and sponsor opportunities available. First time speakers are encouraged to submit their proposals and can expect a helping hand from the organizers and wider community to refine their talks before the big day.
