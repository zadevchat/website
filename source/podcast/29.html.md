Kenneth & Kevin are joined by Danie Roux (@danieroux) & Kevin Trethewey (@KevinTrethewey) to chat about their Spine model, a sensemaking framework for human systems. Danie & Kevin are both involved in doing consulting work, and have distilled the Spine model from their experience helping teams in various companies. Having its roots in Extreme Programming and NLP, the Spine model is about having the right conversations.
