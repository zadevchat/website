Join us as we explore 12 Factor applications and the Polarbear JavaScript scaffold.

READMORE

Kenneth & Kevin chat to Ben Janecke about his Polarbear scaffold for generating 12 Factor applications using node. The scaffold provides users with a React frontend (with server rendering to boot!) and an Express API. We spend a decent amount of time chatting about our different understandings of the 12 Factor principles and how we've used it over the years since being exposed to it by Heroku, and how it influences our design decisions today still.

Polarbear has a home on GitHub at https://github.com/polarbearjs/polarbear and Ben is accepting issues/contributions/feedback!
