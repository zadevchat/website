Kevin & Len are joined by Etienne Marais, a senior PHP developer at Superbalist. Before moving to Cape Town, we met Etienne at the Johannesburg Laravel User meetup that he was organizing. Etienne points us to the TIOBE index, Netcraft's survey and Venturebeat's analysis of popular languages on GitHub, consistently showing PHP as one of the most popular languages in use on the internet today. Etienne has been using PHP for nearly a decade and helps our panelists get up to speed with how PHP has evolved and matured.
