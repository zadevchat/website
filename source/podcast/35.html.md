In this episode Kenneth turns the table on Kevin and chats about a recent successful migration between clouds and architectures.

READMORE

Kevin and his team at Platform45 recently migrated a well established application (www.resourceguruapp.com) from AWS and EngineYard to Google Container Engine. This was a non-trivial migration from a managed platform and a collection of third-party services to a containerised deployment with minimal external dependencies. We talked about the challenges they faced (turned out to be not too many), the new stack they're building on and how Google Container Engine works. We dive deeply into the various components offered by Google's Kubernetes project, the open source technology that powers Google Container Engine, and how Kevin leverages them to take control of his environment.

Technology aside, this does highlight the fact that it is possible to move between cloud providers. The team retooled their deployments to take advantage of Kubernetes' rolling deployments, they migrated their state from AWS to Google Cloud, communicated clearly with their customers and handled one unexpected event gracefully. 

In this age of containerised deployments this could potentially become the norm, whether you move between your own data centers, or between clouds.

The aforementioned video, A technical overview of Kubernetes, by Brendan Burns is well worth watching to help demystify what Kubernetes is and how it can help you get the most of containerising your deployments.
