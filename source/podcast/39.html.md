We take a dive into all things Android, starting with the Play Store and the impact that's made on the app ecosystem before going into the more technical details of building and testing Android apps and the tooling behind it. We speak through some of the nuances of building against Android's APIs and look at alternatives to Java and the ability to interop with native code through Android's NDK.
