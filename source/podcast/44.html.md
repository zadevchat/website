Taking a hard look at accessibility and learning about the principles of inclusive design.

READMORE

Kenneth & Len are joined by Steve Barnett and Justin Slack to talk about building accessible frontends. We quickly learn that building an accessible website doesn't always mean catering for people with permanent disabilities. We learn about inclusive design as well, thinking about temporary impedances to using websites, color blindness and even catering for slow internet connections and HTML email.

Steve & Justin both have considerable experience building websites and they share a goal of promoting and standardizing the practice of building accessible frontends, just like we've defaulted to building responsive interfaces. They recently hosted the only Global Accessibility Awareness Day on the continent in Cape Town where they helped the participants get to grip with what it takes to make an accessible website.

Best of all, it is significantly less work than anyone thought. Hope you enjoy the show!
