What poor development practices get under your skin?

READMORE

In the episode Kenneth, Kevin & Len unpack a few poor software development practices that they've seen over and over again.

More or less in order they tackled long-lived branches in version control, having too many automated tests, being too reliant on your IDE, copying the first answer from StackOverflow and not questioning enough.

Each topic yielded some interesting insights and counterpoints! We hope you enjoy the episode and would love to know what you thought.

Only two resources were mentioned explicitly:

* Michael Feathers - the deep synergy between testability and good design - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVZvoFGJTU
