Chantal, Kenneth & Kevin are joined by Simon Cross, Neil Muller and David Sharpe to talk about the popular Pycon ZA conference and the local Python community in general. Together this experienced, yet humble trio organize Pycon and are involved in various other local Python communities. Simon has a decade of Python under his belt, worked on the Square Kilometer Array and is currently based at Praekelt. Neil is the organizer of the Cape Town Python User Group (CTPUG) and works on medical image processing systems. David started off as an electrical engineer and embedded C programmer and has since "crossed over to the dark side" (his words) as he started using Python more and more.

Despite the techical difficulties of recording this show, it is packed with amazing content and well worth your time.
