Kevin Trethewey is one of the pillars of the local software development community, and has built up a great company and a talented team at Driven Alliance. We had Kevin on the show before talking about the Spine Model. This time round we learn more about his history, how Driven got formed, and the kind of thinking behind building the company.

We hope you enjoy the show and learn as much from Kevin as we did.
